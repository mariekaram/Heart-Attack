# Heart Attack Prediction

Using Machine Learning models to  predict heart attacks before they happen using historical data.

## Dataset 

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments
refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland
database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease
in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply
attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value
0).
